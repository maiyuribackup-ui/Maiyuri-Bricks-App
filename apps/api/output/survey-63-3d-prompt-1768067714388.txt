Create a professional 3D ISOMETRIC FLOOR PLAN visualization for client presentation.

STYLE REFERENCE: Modern architectural 3D isometric floor plan with:
- Bird's eye view at 45-degree isometric angle
- Cutaway walls showing interior layout
- Realistic furniture and fixtures inside each room
- Material textures visible (wood floors, tiles, etc.)
- Soft shadows for depth
- Clean white/cream background with subtle texture
- Professional presentation quality

PROJECT: GROUND FLOOR PLAN - ECO-FRIENDLY COURTYARD HOUSE
SURVEY NO: 63

CRITICAL DIMENSION REQUIREMENTS (MUST BE ACCURATE):
- This is a TRAPEZOIDAL plot (not rectangular)
- North side: 29'-0" (SHORTER side)
- South side: 27'-6" (SHORTER side)
- East side: 41'-0" (LONGER side)
- West side: 43'-0" (LONGER side, road-facing)
- IMPORTANT: East-West dimension (41'-43') is LONGER than North-South (27'-29')
- The plot is taller (deeper) than it is wide

ORIENTATION:
- North arrow pointing UP (top of image)
- Road on WEST side (left side of image when viewed)
- The LONGER dimension runs vertically (East-West = 41'-43')
- The SHORTER dimension runs horizontally (North-South = 27'-29')
