Create a professional 3D ISOMETRIC FLOOR PLAN visualization for client presentation.

STYLE REFERENCE: Modern architectural 3D isometric floor plan with:
- Bird's eye view at 45-degree isometric angle
- Cutaway walls showing interior layout
- Realistic furniture and fixtures inside each room
- Material textures visible (wood floors, tiles, etc.)
- Soft shadows for depth
- Clean white/cream background with subtle texture
- Professional presentation quality

PROJECT: GROUND FLOOR PLAN - ECO-FRIENDLY COURTYARD HOUSE
SURVEY NO: 63

CRITICAL DIMENSION REQUIREMENTS (MUST BE ACCURATE):
- This is a TRAPEZOIDAL plot (not rectangular)
- North side: 29'-0" (SHORTER side, at top)
- South side: 27'-6" (SHORTER side, at bottom)
- East side: 41'-0" (LONGER side, on right)
- West side: 43'-0" (LONGER side, on left, road-facing)
- The plot is approximately 29' wide (North-South) and 42' deep (East-West)
- IMPORTANT: East-West dimension (41'-43') is LONGER than North-South (27.5'-29')
